# ARFoundation-Move-object-after-ground-detection-easier-way-
After Detecting the ground in ARFoundation, Instead of Instantiating the object, it will take the object anywhere  from the space. 

Add your gameobject in the hierarchy and place it somewhere in the scene //position : 1000,1000,1000
ARFoundation Detects the plane and once tapped. The object will be moved to place of touch and stops the plane from detecting further.
